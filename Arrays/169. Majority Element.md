The brute force solution for this problem is to use a hashtable. You keep the count using `count[num]` and check if the count is larger than half of the array size. Since it is guaranteed that a majority element exists, it will return the correct element.

Here is the code and explanation:

```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = {}
        for num in nums:
            count[num] = count.get(num, 0) + 1
            if count[num] > len(nums)//2:
                return num
```

**Explanation:**
- We create an empty dictionary `count` to store the frequency of each number.
- For each number in the array `nums`, we increment its count in the dictionary.
- After updating the count, we check if the current number's count is greater than half the length of the array (`len(nums)//2`).
- If it is, we immediately return that number as the majority element.
- This works because the problem guarantees that a majority element always exists.
