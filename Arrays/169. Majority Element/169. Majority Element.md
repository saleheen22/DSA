The brute force solution for this problem is to use a hashtable. You keep the count using `count[num]` and check if the count is larger than half of the array size. Since it is guaranteed that a majority element exists, it will return the correct element.

Here is the code and explanation:

```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        count = {}
        for num in nums:
            count[num] = count.get(num, 0) + 1
            if count[num] > len(nums)//2:
                return num
```

**Explanation:**
- We create an empty dictionary `count` to store the frequency of each number.
- For each number in the array `nums`, we increment its count in the dictionary.
- After updating the count, we check if the current number's count is greater than half the length of the array (`len(nums)//2`).
- If it is, we immediately return that number as the majority element.
- This works because the problem guarantees that a majority element always exists.

### Optimized Solution: Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm

The most optimized solution for finding the majority element is the **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**. This algorithm works in O(n) time and O(1) space.

Here is the code:

```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        majority = nums[0]
        count = 1
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != majority:
                count -= 1
            else:
                count += 1
            if count == 0:
                majority = nums[i]
                count = 1
        return majority
```

**Explanation:**
- We start by assuming the first element is the majority and set its count to 1.
- As we iterate through the array:
  - If the current element is the same as the current majority, we increment the count.
  - If it is different, we decrement the count.
  - If the count drops to 0, we set the current element as the new majority and reset the count to 1.
- This works because the majority element is guaranteed to appear more than n/2 times, so it will always be the last candidate remaining after this process.
- The algorithm only needs a single pass through the array and uses constant extra space.
