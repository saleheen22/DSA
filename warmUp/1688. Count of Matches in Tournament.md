## 1688. Count of Matches in Tournament

Given `n` teams in a tournament where each match eliminates one team, the total number of matches needed to determine a winner is always `n - 1`.

**Explanation:**  
Each match eliminates one team, so after `n - 1` eliminations, only one team remains.

**Python Solution:**
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfMatches(self, n: int) -> int:
        return n - 1
```
